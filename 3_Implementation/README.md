# Basic Implementation

## Steps needed to implement the project 
The elements involved during the optimization process are: deeper rotor  and stator slots, thinner ferromagnetic sheets, less air-gap, careful manufacturing technology, improved cooling, efficient self-ventilation, high performance ball bearings (less mechanical losses and increased reliability), number of rotor slots, stator coils turns, conductor size, squirrel-cage type, skewing angle for rotor bars, bearings type, magnetic sheet. All these parameters change lead to higher motor efficiency.
