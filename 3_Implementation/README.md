# Basic Implementation

## Steps needed to implement the project 
The elements involved during the optimization process are: deeper rotor  and stator slots, thinner ferromagnetic sheets, less air-gap, careful manufacturing technology, improved cooling, efficient self-ventilation, high performance ball bearings (less mechanical losses and increased reliability), number of rotor slots, stator coils turns, conductor size, squirrel-cage type, skewing angle for rotor bars, bearings type, magnetic sheet. All these parameters change lead to higher motor efficiency.

## Code files

In the above code the calculation of diameter and length of stator is done for easy access of the data and subsequently the speed of the induction machine can be calculated in the next code file.
This acts like a bridge for the engineers who want to directly feed the data and get the output for the certain values which are required while calculating the studying the induction machine.
