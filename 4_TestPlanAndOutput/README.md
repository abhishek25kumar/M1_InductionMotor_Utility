# TestPlan And Output

## High Level Test Plan
A standard 11 kW, 4-pole, 415 Y, 50Hz, 3 phase squirrel cage induction motor was chosen as the test motor. It is a commercial motor with aluminium rotor cage and standard electrical steel. The nominal efficiency value for an IE3 motor of this rating was 9l.9%. The required nominal efficiency value for an IE4 motor of the same rating is 93.3%. The required nominal efficiency value for an IE4 motor of the same rating is 93.3 %. Hence we need to increase the efficiency by 1.4 %. This increase in efficiency will reduce the running costs significantly.
