# M1_InductionMotor_Utility

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/b9aa9ebc68604f2086314c66dd2cdd7d)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/abhishek25kumar/M1_InductionMotor_Utility?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=abhishek25kumar/M1_InductionMotor_Utility&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

The main objective of the project work is to design and optimize suitable motor defining the desired torque-speed-efficiency map, adapting its performance to the hydraulic characteristics of the water pump or electric vehicle.

## Main Objective of this activity
A basic calculation is done for calculating diameter and length of the induction machine and also subsequently calculating the speed of the machine as well.
This project helps in bridging the time taken to calculate the dimensions manually and brings a new innovative idea among the colleagues as well.
